# Assignment 5 - DATA 1202-02
The goal of this Jupyter Notebook was to using the Youtube channel dataset provide an example in Python of how to answer the follow questions:
1- Create a function to calculate the distribution of channeltype from the top 1000 records.
2- Load only the top 1000 records of the original 4000 into a separate CSV file, and to a database table. 

That was accomplished by using pandas library. First, I loaded the csv file into a pandas DataFrame. Then, I created two functions and employed them to help me achieve the assigment goal. Finally, it generated a series that was converted to a DataFrame that was lastly transformed into a new csv file.
